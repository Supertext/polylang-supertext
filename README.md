# Polylang Supertext

## Description

This plugin can only be used with polylang. It allows the user to send a certain post or page to
the supertext translation service. After translation, the page or post is automatically translated
in your WordPress installation. It works for every post type that is translatable by polylang.

You can let supertext translate content, title, excerpt and image captions at this moment.
Just choose to "get translation offer" instead of creating the new page with polylang. See the offers,
choose one and you'll be notified once your translated page or post has been inserted to your website.
