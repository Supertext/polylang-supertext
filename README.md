# Supertext Translation

## Description

This plugin allows the user to send a WordPress post or page to Supertext for translation.
Once completed, the translation will be automatically inserted into a new page or post in your WordPress installation.
This works for every post type that is translatable by Polylang.

Supertext can translate content, titles, excerpts, image captions, shortcode arguments and custom fields.
Simply order a translation instead of creating a new page with Polylang.
You will be presented with services, prices and deadlines. Select the right one for you and you'll be notified by email once your translated page or post has been uploaded to your website.

**Please note**

Translatable custom fields must be defined in the settings. Supported plugins at the moment are:
- Advanced Custom Fields
- Yoast SEO
- All In One SEO pack

If the field is not available in one of the lists, you can define it by adding self defined custom fields.

Plugin has been tested with following page builders:
- Visual Composer
- Beaver Builder
- BE page builder
- Divi page builder
- SiteOrigin page builder
